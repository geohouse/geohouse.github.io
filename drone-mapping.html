        This is a collection of projects that are all based on aerial drone
        imagery that I have flown and collected in different settings. I have
        used these images to create perspective-corrected aerial maps, digital
        surface models that show differences in landscape height, and 3-D
        models. These projects represent all of those outputs from drone images
        and demonstrate some of the applications of drone-based mapping that I
        find most interesting:

          Measuring steep topographic differences where hiking is impossible
        </li>

        <li>3-D capturing of historic structures.</li>

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="overview-holder">
      <p class="overview">
        All the projects have interactive output to allow exploring the data,
        regardless of whether they're maps or 3-D models. The models also
        include tools to measure distances and heights of any feature in the
        model.

    <div class="details">
      <p>
        For projects with interactive maps, they can be panned and zoomed like
        any other webmap, except the imagery shown is fully constructed from
        aerial drone photographs that have fine spatial resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are toggle controls for the user to choose whether show the
        digital surface model instead of the default imagery. This surface model
        is derived from the imagery and shows the relative surface elevations of
        landscape features using an artificial color scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        For projects with 3-D models based on the drone imagery, the models can
        be panned, zoomed, and rotated using multiple mouse buttons. A context
        menu is also accessible to access tools including rulers to measure
        distances and heights of objects in the model and to change the amount
        of model detail that's displayed.

        I processed the drone imagery using with open-source WebODM software. I
        then used the Leaflet Javascript library for the maps and the Potree
        Javascript library for the 3-D models.

        I first collected the aerial imagery with the required high amount of
        overlap between successive images with the help of automated drone
        flight software (using the Pix4DCapture app).
      </p>
      <p>
        I then used WebODM software to process these raw images into
        orthorectified composite images, digital surface models (2-D), and full
        3-D models of landscape features. This output raster map tiles for the
        orthorectified images and the digital surface models. I could use these
        map tiles directly with the Leaflet Javascript library to build
        interactive webmaps that allowed you to toggle between displaying the
        imagery and displaying the digital surface model. It also output point
        cloud files that I could convert into files compatible with the Potree
        Javascript library that efficiently renders large point clouds so they
        can be explored interactively on websites.

        After getting my FAA Part 107 remote pilot's license, I was keen to
        experiment with creating mapping-related output from aerial drone
        images. I bought a drone capable of supervised, but pre-programmed
        flights for mapping (a Parrot Anafi), and set about testing it in
        different mapping scenarios. This gave me more hands-on experience with
        mission planning for drone mapping, collecting the images during
        supervised autonomous flight, and processing the output using the
        excellent open-source WebODM image analysis software built for this
        purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        That resulted in analyzed output on my local computer, but I wanted to
        make it easily explorable through interactive websites as well.
        Displaying the output maps using Leaflet was straightforward after my
        experience with the Block Island Glass Float project, but displaying the
        3-D models using Potree was another important skill to have developed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, I'm very proud of the outcome of these projects so far both
        in terms of learning process of drone-based mapping, and in
        demonstrating how useful this mapping can be in a range of applications.

        The projects here generally follow the same technical design, with the
        major difference being whether the project shows 2-D mapping output or
        3-D modelling output from the drone-collected images. However, each
        project purposefully highlights different capabilities of drone-based
        mapping. This has certainly been a learning process, trying different
        projects to see which work well (the ones highlighted here), and
        learning from those that didn't.

        I'm most proud of the details some of the projects show, from detailed
        3-D reconstructions to changes in flowering plants and leaf-out during
        the growing season.

      <p>
        The digital surface models can do an excellent job capturing strong
        topographic changes, like in the deep and narrow canyon that would not
        be possible to map by foot. They also do a good job measuring subtle
        changes, like differences in plant height through the growing season and
        with plant pruning.
      </p>
      <p>
        The orthorectified images key well to each other even when generated
        during independent flights, and this can provide important extensions of
        an initial map either spatially or through time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, detail contained in 3-D models enable measurements to be made
        on snapshots of structure conditions, including the ability to monitor
        condition changes over time.

        The biggest challenge was figuring out how to serve the 3-D model
        results as an interactive website given hosting constraints.

        The WebODM software calculates the 3-D model based on the drone images
        and outputs this information in compressed point cloud files (<span
          class="monospace"
          >.laz</span
        >
        files). These need to be converted to a different file format before
        they can be rendered with the Potree interactive viewer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first tried this conversion using the newest version of the Potree
        viewer, which produces only 3 output files. However, this project uses
        GitHub for version control and web hosting, and one of those files was
        too large to include on GitHub so I started looking for an alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found that the older version of the Potree converter outputs many
        small files instead, which would be compatible with GitHub, so I used
        that and modified the Potree rendering code to work with this older
        style of converted file. This let me set up a re-producible pipeline to
        convert the WebODM 3-D model output into data that could be rendered
        using the Potree interactive viewer in any website.

        These projects gave me applied experience with a drone-based mapping
        workflow from flying the mission to building websites that allow
        interactive exploration of the mapping or modeling results. I also
        gained an understanding about the strengths and limitations of this
        aerial mapping. It is excellent for tracking landscape changes over time
        in the same area and allowing measurements to be taken from its 3-D
        models. However, it doesn't do well in modeling tree canopies or narrow
        structures, like utility bridges.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can use these results to gauge how effective drone-based mapping may
        be for future projects. In cases where drone mapping would be useful, I
        can now provide a quick turn-around time between the drone flight and
        delivering an interactive website for exploring the resulting maps and
        models.
