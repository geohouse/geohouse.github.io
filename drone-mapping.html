        This is a collection of projects that are all based on aerial drone
        imagery that I have flown and collected in different settings. I have
        used these images to create perspective-corrected aerial maps, digital
        surface models that show differences in landscape height, and 3-D
        models. These projects represent all of those outputs from drone images
        and demonstrate some of the applications of drone-based mapping that I
        find most interesting:

    <div class="overview-holder">
      <p class="overview">
        All the projects have interactive output to allow exploring the data,
        regardless of whether they're maps or 3-D models. The models also
        include tools to measure distances and heights of any feature in the
        model.

      For projects with interactive maps, they can be panned and zoomed like any
      other webmap, except the imagery shown is fully constructed from aerial
      drone photographs that have fine spatial resolution. There are toggle
      controls for the user to choose whether show the digital surface model
      instead of the default imagery. This surface model is derived from the
      imagery and shows the relative surface elevations of landscape features
      using an artificial color scale. For projects with 3-D models based on the
      drone imagery, the models can be panned, zoomed, and rotated using
      multiple mouse buttons. A context menu is also accessible to access tools
      including rulers to measure distances and heights of objects in the model
      and to change the amount of model detail that's displayed.

        I processed the drone imagery using with open-source WebODM software. I
        then used the Leaflet Javascript library for the maps and the Potree
        Javascript library for the 3-D models.

      I first collected the aerial imagery with the required high amount of
      overlap between successive images with the help of automated drone flight
      software (using the Pix4DCapture app). I then used WebODM software to
      process these raw images into orthorectified composite images, digital
      surface models (2-D), and full 3-D models of landscape features. This
      output raster map tiles for the orthorectified images and the digital
      surface models. I could use these directly with the Leaflet Javascript
      library to build interactive webmaps that allowed you to toggle between
      displaying the imagery and displaying the digital surface model. It also
      output point cloud files that I could convert into files compatible with
      the Potree Javascript library that efficiently renders large point clouds
      so they can be explored interactively on websites.

      After getting my FAA Part 107 remote pilot's license, I was keen to
      experiment with creating mapping-related output from aerial drone images.
      I bought drone capable of supervised, but pre-programmed flights for
      mapping (a Parrot Anafi), and set about testing it in different mapping
      scenarios. This gave me more hands-on experience with mission planning for
      drone mapping, collecting the images during supervised autonomous flight,
      and processing the output using the excellent open-source WebODM image
      analysis software built for this purpose. That resulted in analyzed output
      on my local computer, but I wanted to make it easily explorable through
      interactive websites as well. Displaying the output maps using Leaflet was
      straightforward after my experience with the Block Island Glass Float
      project, but displaying the 3-D models using Potree was another important
      skill to have developed. Ultimately, I'm very proud of the outcome of
      these projects so far both in terms of learning process of drone-based
      mapping, and in demonstrating how useful this mapping can be in a range of
      applications.

      The projects here generally follow the same technical design, with the
      major difference being whether the project shows 2-D mapping output or 3-D
      modelling output from the drone-collected images. However, each project
      purposefully highlights different capabilities of drone-based mapping. I
      have sought out opportunities to use my drone to capture seasonal
      differences in plant growth for the same location through the growing
      year, to see how well its output can capture

      outcomes. Deep relief; corroborating detail in independent maps from
      overlapping flights; detail contained in 3-D models that enable
      measurements to be made on snapshots of structure conditions (could be
      used to monitor condition changes over time)

        The biggest challenge was figuring out how to serve the 3-D model

      The WebODM software calculates the 3-D model based on the drone images and
      outputs this information in compressed point cloud files (<span

        >.laz</span
      >
      files). These need to be converted to a different file format before they
      can be rendered with the Potree interactive viewer. I first tried this
      conversion using the newest version of the Potree viewer, which produces
      only 3 output files. However, this project uses GitHub for version control
      and web hosting, and one of those files was too large to include on GitHub
      so I started looking for an alternative. I found that the older version of
      the Potree converter outputs many small files instead, which would be
      compatible with GitHub, so I used that and modified the Potree rendering
      code to work with this older style of converted file. This let me set up a
      re-producible pipeline to convert the WebODM 3-D model output into data
      that could be rendered using the Potree interactive viewer in any website.

        This turned out to be an excellent project for learning a lot of skills
        related to interactive mapping. It required cleaning and organizing
        crowd-sourced data, implementing a range of ways users could interact
        with the mapped data, and managing project development from both the
        input (data) and output (mapping) ends simultaneously.

    </div>
    <p class="details">
      Through this project, I learned a lot more about building interactive
      webmaps, which is what I had wanted. This included having maps be
      responsive to a range of different user input types, and to access the
      correct datasets as required to meet the user's specifications. I also
      worked with fuzzy string matching and creating geoJSON output files from
      Python scripts, which were key foundations to providing the data for the
      map to display. This also required project management skills to balance
      the progress of both the mapping and the data cleaning/packaging
      successfully, building the required proof-of-concepts, and quickly
      catching and addressing challenges as they arose. In that sense, I was
      building from the ends of the project toward the middle, but I knew this
      would work because geoJSON file standardization ensured that the dataset
      output would work seamlessly as the required mapping input. I have already
      leveraged some of these skills through the project mapping crop rotations
      in Minnesota.
