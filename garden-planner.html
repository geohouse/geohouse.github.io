        A visual tool to help maximize your garden's ability to support wildlife

      Gardens can be excellent in supporting a variety of key wildlife, such as
      pollinators and birds. Planning a garden to attract a range of wildlife
      through the growing season and beyond is not always easy, as it requires a
      holistic approach to bloom times, fruiting times, and other key aspects
      that attract wildlife. This project seeks to make this process easier by
      visually representing the blooming, fruiting, and other important wildlife
      attracting times through the growing season for multiple plants
      simultaneously, allowing gaps in timing to be easily found so that the
      plant plan can be amended accordingly.

      This app lets you input detailed information about the wildlife attracted
      by the flowers, fruit/seeds, or leaves/other aspects of each plant,
      including the time of year and type of wildlife attracted for each. It
      then aggregates this information into a set of standardized plant 'cards'
      to allow easier comparison of features across plants. Finally, the
      information in the plant 'cards' is also presented visually with a graph
      that shows the times of blooming, fruiting, and other wildlife attracting
      qualities through the year for the whole garden at once, along with the
      types of wildlife that are attracted by each. The 'cards' and the graph
      can be easily sorted by the blooming, fruiting, or other wildlife
      attracting times through the year for any number of plants, which makes it
      easy to see at a glance whether there are time gaps in attracting key
      wildlife to the garden using the current plants, and the plan can be
      updated based on that by easily deleting existing plants or adding new
      ones.

      This application uses React through several related functional components
      to easily manage the state (list of plants for the garden and their
      characteristics) and its display. I use the ChartJS library for making the
      interactive graph, with bindings for React. All the components are written
      in TypeScript, which helps prevent type-related bugs and makes it easier
      to ensure the props passed between React components are properly
      standardized. React Testing Library and Jest are used to provide unit and
      integration tests for the app.

        I recently planted a garden to try and attract wildlife, but was missing
        an easy way to more easily modify my planting plan based on plant
        blooming and fruiting times to try and ensure more consistent food
        sources for wildlife. This app is the tool I wish I had when planning
        the garden.

      Having recently planned and planted a garden where I wanted to attract as
      much wildlife as possible through the growing season, I wanted to create
      an app to make garden planning for wildlife easier. Especially in urban
      and suburban areas, gardens can provide important habitat and food
      resources for wildlife. Planning gardens for wildlife whenever possible is
      important to be able to sustain and attract biodiversity back to these
      built-up areas. While each individual garden cannot make a large
      difference, many nearby gardens planned to attract wildlife through the
      growing season can have a large collective impact and making this aspect
      of garden planning easier is important to me.

        Using React to manage the central plant list was helpful, with separate
        components for plant input, plant 'cards' showing each plants'
        characteristics, and the visual comparison of plants through the year.

      <button type="button" class="collapse-button">+</button>

        My main goal was to allow users to input plants with different
        characteristics for blooms, fruits, and other attributes that may
        attract wildlife (like leaves for butterfly caterpillars) and to have
        those attributes plotted together on a graph through a growing season.
        This would make it very easy to spot parts of the season where, say,
        hummingbirds wouldn't have any flowers to visit in the garden, and you
        could update the planting plan to help fill that gap. To make this
        happen, I set up the app using React as a framework to manage the
        different components that were involved and to pass the state of the
        different components efficiently between them to allow for easy
        rendering and a dynamic website. There are three major groups of
        components for this app:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Adding plant information through input fields, date and color
          selectors, and checkboxes for wildlife types that the plant attracts
        </li>
        <li>
          A list of the plants entered for the garden that shows an overview of
          the qualities of each of the plants
        </li>
        <li>
          A graph that displays the information in the plant list graphically
          through a year to see overlapping bloom times and colors, fruiting
          times, and other features that may attract wildlife, and the specific
          types of wildlife that are attracted by each
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I am a firm believer in making user interactions as easy and intuitive
        as possible and I built custom selector components as needed to help
        facilitate this. For example, I built date selectors as a group of
        buttons that could easily be 'painted' over while clicking and dragging
        a mouse to select multiple months quickly and easily along with 'select
        all' and 'select none' buttons that activate and de-activate based on
        the context.
        <br />
        Once the plants are plotted, the list and graph can be sorted together
        by bloom time, fruit time, or the time other wildlife are attracted to
        see the wildlife attracted by the plants in the current garden plan in
        order through the year.

      I'm most proud of the chart output. This is the main output from the app,
      and it needs to be intuitive to read and understand otherwise people would
      not want to use it for garden planning. Behind-the-scenes it handles
      different scenarios to try and keep the chart as informative and easy to
      understand as possible. This also required working with a version of the
      Chart library with special bindings for React, which behaves slightly
      differently from the regular Chart library.

        The codebase for this app includes code testing at various levels
        through this project, including typechecking using Typescript, which was
        sometimes challenging to implement. It was also a challenge to make the
        app as accessible as possible with the different input and visual
        elements.

      I knew I wanted this project to include as much testing as possible to
      ensure future changes would not break current functionality. Implementing
      integration tests was sometimes tricky, especially for a Chart testing
      problem where `resize-observer` was required for the Chart library, but is
      not supported by JestDOM, which I was using for testing. After searching
      for possible solutions online, I tried more elegant seeming solutions
      using mock functions without success and so I finally used a polyfill
      instead, which solved my problem. Because this is just used for testing
      and not core application functionality, this seemed like a workable
      solution.
      <br />
      I also migrated the existing code from JavaScript to TypeScript, and this
      translation was sometimes difficult, especially for getting correct typing
      when using dynamic indexing into nested objects that contain multiple
      types. To address this, I read multiple TypeScript references to better
      understand different solutions and made extensive use of `keyof` and
      `typeof` operators to provide correct type checking for dynamic indexing
      into nested objects without necessarily needing to specify a pre-defined
      type or interface to follow for the typing.

      This project is accessible except for the dynamically produced graph. I
      have ensured that all the inputs are accessible by keyboard using tabIndex
      attributes as needed, and that the elements of the plant cards are
      accessible. Making the dynamic chart accessible is harder, as it is meant
      to be a visual representation of the plants in the plan and making that
      consistently accessible to users who are not able to see the chart is
      tricky. All the information in the chart is contained in the plant cards
      though, and I have ensured that those are accessible. The plant cards get
      sorted the same as the graph when the user selects a sort button, so it is
      still possible to get insights about time gaps in wildlife attraction
      through the year for the current garden plants even if the user is not
      able to view the chart.

      I learned a large amount from this project. Working with React across
      multiple related components, it was good practice with lifting state up to
      the closest shared component and having references to state changing
      functions be passed down to the individual components that needed them.
      Working with Chart for React was helpful to understand how they work
      together and how it is possible to produce data-driven visualizations
      based on state that is managed by React. This also was very helpful
      practice with creating and using unit and integration tests to help ensure
      future changes would not affect the current functionality. The experience
      of translating JavaScript code to TypeScript was also extremely useful to
      understand how powerful TypeScript can be in providing checks as a first
      line of testing for React component code, especially with elements of
      objects and ensuring props objects are packaged and passed correctly
      between components.
