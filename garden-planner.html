        A visual tool to help maximize your garden's ability to support wildlife
        by making it easier to ensure longer periods during the year where
        flowers, fruits/seeds, or other plant characteristics for wildlife are

        Gardens can be excellent in supporting a variety of key wildlife, such
        as pollinators and birds. Planning a garden to attract a range of
        wildlife through the growing season and beyond is not always easy
        though, because it requires a holistic approach to bloom times, fruiting
        times, and other key qualities that attract wildlife.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to make this process easier by visually representing the
        blooming, fruiting, and other important wildlife attracting times
        through the growing season for multiple plants simultaneously. This
        allows gaps in timing to be easily found so that the plant plan can be
        amended accordingly.

        Enter information about blooming, fruiting, and other wildlife

        This app lets you input detailed information about the wildlife
        attracted by the flowers, fruit/seeds, or leaves/other qualities of each
        plant, including the time of year and type of wildlife attracted for
        each.
      </p>
      <p>
        It then aggregates this information into a set of standardized plant
        'cards' to allow easier comparison of features across plants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the information in the plant 'cards' is also presented visually
        with a graph that shows the times of blooming, fruiting, and other
        wildlife attracting qualities through the year for the whole garden at
        once, along with the types of wildlife that are attracted by each.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 'cards' and the graph can be easily sorted by the blooming,
        fruiting, or other wildlife attracting times through the year for any
        number of plants, which makes it easy to see at a glance whether there
        are time gaps in attracting key wildlife to the garden using the current
        plants. The garden plan can then be updated based on that information by
        easily deleting existing plants or adding new ones.

        This is a React-based app written in TypeScript with code tests

        This application uses several related functional components built with
        React to easily manage its state (the list of plants for the garden and
        their characteristics) and its display. I use the ChartJS library for
        making the interactive graph, with bindings for React. All the
        components are written in TypeScript, which helps prevent type-related
        bugs and makes it easier to ensure the props passed between React
        components are properly structured. React Testing Library and Jest are
        used to provide unit and integration tests for the app.

        I recently planted a garden to try and attract wildlife, but missed
        having an easy way to summarize blooming and fruiting times to help
        ensure more consistent food sources for wildlife. This app is the tool I
        wish I had when planning the garden.

        Effectively planning gardens to provide habitat and/or food for wildlife
        wherever possible, but especially in urban and suburban areas, is
        important to help sustain and attract biodiversity back to these areas.
        Having recently planned and planted a garden where I wanted to attract
        as much wildlife as possible in a small space, I wanted to create an app
        to make garden planning for wildlife easier. This app highlights the
        timing for flowering, fruiting, and other wildlife attracting qualities
        for all plants in the current plan so that it can be modified as needed
        to provide better continuity for wildlife through the year.

      <h2>Project design</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="overview-holder">
      <p class="overview">
        React effectively manages the state of the app through the central plant
        list stored in a parent component. This plant list is then updated or
        read by separate components for plant input, plant 'cards' showing each
        plants' characteristics, and the visual comparison of plants through the
        year.
      </p>
      <button type="button" class="collapse-button">+</button>
    </div>
    <div class="details">
      <p>
        My main goal was to allow users to input plants with different
        characteristics for blooms, fruits, and other attributes that may
        attract wildlife (like leaves for butterfly caterpillars) and to have
        those attributes plotted together on a graph through a growing season.
        This would make it very easy to spot parts of the season where, say,
        hummingbirds wouldn't have any flowers to visit in the garden, and you
        could update the planting plan to help fill that gap.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make this happen, I set up the app using React as a framework to
        manage the plant list (the app's state) and to allow functional
        components that modify or display the list in different ways based on
        user needs.
        <strong
          >There are three major groups of components for this app:</strong
        >
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Adding plant information through input fields, custom date and color
          selectors (their own functional components), and checkboxes for
          wildlife types that the plant attracts
        </li>
        <li>
          A list of 'cards' for the plants entered for the garden that shows an
          overview of the qualities of each of the plants
        </li>
        <li>
          A visual display of the information in the plant list through a year
          to see overlapping bloom times and colors, fruiting times, and other
          qualities that may attract wildlife, and the specific types of
          wildlife that are attracted by each
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        It is important to me to make user interactions as easy and intuitive as
        possible, and I built custom selector components as needed to help
        facilitate this. For example, I built date selectors as a group of
        buttons that could easily be 'painted' over while clicking and dragging
        a mouse to select multiple months quickly and easily along with 'select
        all' and 'select none' buttons that activate and de-activate based on
        the context.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the plants are plotted, the list and graph can be sorted together
        by bloom time, fruit time, or the time where other plant qualities
        attract wildlife to get a yearly overview for the current garden plan.

        I'm happy with the chart output. It allows quick comparisons of
        different plant characteristics through the growing season. This was the
        main goal of the app.

        I'm most proud of the chart output. This is the main output from the
        app, and it needs to be intuitive to read and understand otherwise
        people would not want to use it for garden planning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind-the-scenes it handles different scenarios to try and keep the
        chart as informative and easy to understand as possible. This also
        required working with a version of the Chart library with special
        bindings for React, which behaves slightly differently from the regular
        Chart library.

      <h2>Challenges I ran into and how I resolved them</h2>

    <div class="overview-holder">
      <p class="overview">
        The codebase for this app includes testing at various levels, including
        typechecking using Typescript, which was sometimes challenging to
        implement. It was also a challenge to make the app as accessible as
        possible with the different input and visual elements.
      </p>
      <button type="button" class="collapse-button">+</button>
    </div>
    <div class="details">
      <ul>
        <li>
          I knew I wanted this project to include as much automated code testing
          as possible to ensure future changes would not break current
          functionality.
          <p class="more-details">
            Implementing integration tests was sometimes tricky, especially for
            a Chart testing problem where
            <span class="monospace">resize-observer</span> was required for the
            Chart library, but is not supported by JestDOM, which I was using
            for testing. After searching for possible solutions online, I tried
            more elegant seeming solutions using mock functions without success
            before finally using a polyfill instead, which solved my problem.
            Because this is just used for testing and not core application
            functionality, this seemed like a workable solution.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          I also migrated the codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript after much
          of the core functionality was already operational, and this
          translation was sometimes difficult, especially for getting correct
          typing when using dynamic indexing into nested objects that contain
          multiple types.
          <p class="more-details">
            To address this, I read several TypeScript references to better
            understand different solutions and made extensive use of
            <span class="monospace">keyof</span> and
            <span class="monospace">typeof</span> operators to provide correct
            type checking for dynamic indexing into nested objects without
            necessarily needing to pre-define a type or interface to follow for
            the typing.

        This project is accessible except for the dynamically produced graph. I
        have ensured that all the inputs are accessible by keyboard using
        <span class="monospace">tabIndex</span>
        attributes as needed, and that the elements of the plant cards are
        accessible. Making the dynamic chart accessible is harder, as it is
        meant to be a visual representation of the plants in the plan and making
        that consistently accessible to users who are not able to see the chart
        is tricky. All the information in the chart is contained in the plant
        cards though, and I have ensured that those are accessible. The plant
        cards get sorted the same as the graph when the user selects a sort
        button, so it is still possible to get insights about time gaps in
        wildlife attraction through the year for the current garden plants even
        if the user is not able to view the chart.

      <h2>What I learned for future projects</h2>

    <div class="overview-holder">
      <p class="overview">
        I learned to build complexity into React apps step-by-step and to
        re-factor components as needed based on that increased complexity. This
        also gave me experience migrating an existing JavaScript app to
        TypeScript and implementing code tests.

      <button type="button" class="collapse-button">+</button>

    <div class="details">
      <p>
        I learned a large amount from this project. Working with React across
        multiple related functional components was good practice with lifting
        state up to the closest shared component and having references to the
        state-changing functions be passed down to the individual components as
        needed. Using Chart for React was helpful to understand how it is
        possible to produce data-driven visualizations based on state that is
        managed by React. This also was useful practice creating and using unit
        and integration tests to help ensure future code changes would not
        affect the current functionality. The experience of translating
        JavaScript code to TypeScript was also quite useful to understand how
        powerful TypeScript can be in providing checks as a first line of
        testing for React component code, especially with elements of objects
        and ensuring props objects are packaged and passed correctly between
        components.
